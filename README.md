# What is SuperNova Framework

SuperNova is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. It is a combination of both CodeIgniter and Laravel Frameworks in terms of easiness and functionality. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. SuperNova lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

## Server Requirements

PHP version 7.1 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.6 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.

## Installation

Download or Clone Repo to your Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tansheetalitaj/supernova-framework.git
cd supernova-framework
```
